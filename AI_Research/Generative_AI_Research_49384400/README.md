# AI_Research

To keep the research materials well-structured and easy to navigate, the repository is organized into several main categories:

1. AI\_Research/

   Core research folder, contains project-specific data, scripts, and documentation.
   All contents are now tracked as a regular folder (not as a submodule) to simplify version control.

2. Data\_for\_Analysis/

   Stores raw and processed data used in quantitative and qualitative analysis.
   Includes survey data, experiment results, and analysis scripts.

3. Literature Review documents/

   Contains journal and conference articles, reports, and references collected for the literature review section of the project.

4. Drafts and Reports/

   Holds project proposals, intermediate drafts, and final reports for documentation and submission.

5. Additional Materials/Figures/

   Keeps supporting materials such as figures, charts, and visualizations that are referenced in drafts or presentations.
